# My Bio
My name is Ilias and I am studying Data and Information Science.
I am especially interested in data modeling and how data can be used in practice.
In my studies I like working with real datasets and tools like Git, the command line, and Python.
In my free time I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my workflows step by step.
