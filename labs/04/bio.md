# About Me
My name is Ilias and I am studying Data and Information Science at TH Köln.
I am especially interested in data modeling and how data can be used in practice.
I also want to improve my skills with version control tools like Git in real projects.
In my free time I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my workflows step by step.
