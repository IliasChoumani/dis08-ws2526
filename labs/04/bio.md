# My Bio
My name is Ilias and I am studying Data and Information Science at TH Köln.
I am especially interested in data modeling, data structures, and how data can be used in practice.
Working with Git and different branches helps me understand version control and organize my projects better.
I enjoy learning about scripting, automation and tools that can support research workflows.
In my free time, I like experimenting with software tools and exploring new approaches to solving problems.
