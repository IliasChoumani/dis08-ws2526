# My Bio
My name is Ilias and I am currently exploring different areas of Data and Information Science.
I particularly enjoy learning about data processing, scripting and how tools can automate workflows.
Working with Git and understanding version control concepts helps me structure my projects better.
Outside my studies I like experimenting with tech tools and discovering efficient ways to work.
